    <p>Bub, gusto ko lang sabihin kung gaano kita ka-appreciate, not just for what you do, but for who you are. Thank you for your patience, your understanding, at sa pagmamahal na ibinibigay mo araw-araw. The way you care, listen, and stay kahit mahirap na means so much to me. You make me feel safe, valued, and heard, and that’s something I’ll never take for granted.
</p>
    <p>I appreciate every effort you give, every reassurance, at bawat pagkakataon na pinipili mo pa rin ako. Your presence brings comfort and peace into my life, and I’m grateful every day that I get to have you. Bub, you are more than enough, and I’m truly thankful for you and everything you are.</p>
